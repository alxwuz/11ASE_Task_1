# **11SE Task 1 2025 - ??? Application**
## Designed and Documented by Alex Wu
This is where all the documentation and development will occur.
# Requirements Definition
## Funtional Requirements
- **Data Retrieval:** What does the user need to be able to view in the system? 

The user must view the data that is obtained from the dataset. If there are any errors due to not having any data or something else, there will need to specify if there isn't any data or not. For example, if a movie in a dataset did not have the time of release, then it should say something like N/A, and not an error so the user knows the information is unavailable.

- **User Interface:** What is required for the user to interact with the system?

For the user to interact with the system, the requirement will need to be a command-line interface which allows the user to understand what is happening, and use the application to connect with the API without any bugs or problems. The program will also need to be able to sort and configure the dataset for some sections of the info, such as showing the descending order from a chosen category.

- **Data Display:** What information does the user need to obtain from the system?

The user needs to be able to access all of the data from the chosen API. There cannot be any modifications of the dataset, and errors need to be

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** How well does the system need to perform? 

The sytem needs to be fairly efficient as it cannot be too slow and perform the sorting slowly. This isn't really hard as python is a fairly fast programming language, and with the help of other modules, it can be pretty fast.

- **Reliability:** How reliable does the system and data need to be?

In terms of reliability, it is only the API that affects this. Therefore, a trustable API must be found. There isn't really any "bad" APIs, but if you choose an unofficial or undeveloped one, then there may be a problem, so any API will do, especially from https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis, which is where the API for this project is found.

- **Usability and Accessibility:** How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?

The instructions can be found in the README.md, where there will be a guide on how to use the program, including how to install the required dependencies.import requests
